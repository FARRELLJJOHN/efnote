## What is EFNote?
EFNote is designed to streamflow journalling, notetaking, bug-reporting, or any
other formattable text writing you do.

EFNote is also in heavy development so changes will be frequent and functions
will be limited.

## Features

**Disclaimer:** None of this is currently implemented, check back in a week.

* **Custom format note taking**: Easily create journals, to-do lists, revision logs, etc.; all with your own format. Don't be restricted to a journal with only name, date, and content!
* **Easily search between all EFNote entries**: Whether it be a shopping list, bug report, or diary, easily find what you're looking for between all entries with a dead-simple search interface.
* **Uses your default text editor**: Vim, Emacs, Nano, doesn't matter. Use what you love.
* **Secure, persistant storage**: Don't let anyone see your super-secret diary entries unless you want them to.
